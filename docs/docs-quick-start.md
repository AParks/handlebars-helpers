For linting and testing this project uses Grunt `~0.4.1`, but Grunt is **not required** to use the helpers. Check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide to learn more about Grunt.

```shell
npm install helper-lib --save-dev
```
Once helper-lib has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('helper-lib');
```
